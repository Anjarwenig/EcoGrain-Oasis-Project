### About

EcoGrain Oasis project helps new small enterprises' owners to develop simple programs to operate their store inventory, especially for grain or food products. This program is best for new owners since it has the automation system to input the code or product id, making it stored in numerical order. 
It also offers you necessary features including:


1. **Show menu**, displays the entire stock inside the database. The stock will always be updated.
2. **Add**, used to input new items in the database. The code as the key value will be automatically updated by the system. Then it will allow the user to input the other details; product name, quantity/ stock, price.
3. **Update Database**,it allows users to make updates to the items inside the database by input the code as the key value.
4. **Delete**, allows the user to remove any item that is no longer available in the database for some reasons whether it is no longer being sold or expired. 
5. **View Statisticse**, allow users to check the total stock and total values. 
6. **Filter by type**, displays the products by the type; organic and non organic.
